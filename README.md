At work we lost access to github (what will CEOs think of next), we still needed a way to sync Matlab pwd to and from the server across the team. Yes we could manually shove folders around but this was a nice GUI enchanced way to be able to push and pull commits with a mirror mode or less strict options.

Could use additional testing, perhaps adding some CLI capabilities would allow scheduling commits.
